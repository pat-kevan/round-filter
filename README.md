# round-filter

Basic premise - modified Joe's filter with some complexity removed and de-emphasis on backgrounds and borders

- Logical colours on:
  1. Food (light brown)
  2. Endgame potions including raid supplies (potion colour)
  3. Herbs and herb seeds (green, good herbs are brighter)
- Emphasised uniques and high value items (icons, lootbeams, larger font and sounds)
- 10M+ items are bolded as well
- Item icons only for:
  1. Noted items
  2. Runes
- Most other items have default styling similar to ground items
